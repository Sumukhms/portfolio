Sumukh M S - Full-Stack Developer Portfolio


![Comic Style 'Welcome' Banner]

WHOOSH! A VISITOR!
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal portfolio! This isn't just a project; it's a dynamic and interactive showcase of my journey as a full-stack developer, presented with a fun, comic book-inspired theme.

This portfolio is built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It dynamically fetches my latest projects from the GitHub API and uses EmailJS to power the contact form.

About Me
I'm Sumukh M S, a 7th-semester Computer Science student with a passion for building creative and impactful web applications. I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and have a strong interest in AI/ML.

I am a dedicated and curious learner, always looking for opportunities to apply my skills to real-world challenges and contribute to innovative tech solutions.

Featured Projects
Here are a few of the projects you'll find showcased in my portfolio:

Edugram: A MERN-based social learning platform that allows students to collaborate, share events, and engage in discussions.

InvestIQ: An AI-driven platform that analyzes startup data to provide recommendations for funding and predict success.

EchoMood: A mood-based music playlist generator that detects emotions from facial expressions, text, and voice to create adaptive playlists.

Color Detection Project: A computer vision tool built with OpenCV that can identify single and multiple colors from a live webcam feed.

You can find more of my work in the "Projects" section of my portfolio website!

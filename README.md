# Sumukh M S - Full-Stack Developer Portfolio

## WHOOSH! A VISITOR!

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal portfolio! This isn't just a project; it's a dynamic and interactive showcase of my journey as a full-stack developer, presented with a fun, comic book-inspired theme.

This portfolio is built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. It dynamically fetches my latest projects from the **GitHub API** and uses **EmailJS** to power the contact form.

## About Me

I'm Sumukh M S, a 7th-semester Computer Science student with a passion for building creative and impactful web applications. I specialize in the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and have a strong interest in **AI/ML**. My goal is to leverage these technologies to create intelligent and intuitive user experiences.

I am a dedicated and curious learner, always looking for opportunities to apply my skills to real-world challenges and contribute to innovative tech solutions.

## Featured Projects

Here are a few of the projects you'll find showcased in my portfolio:

  * **Edugram:** A MERN-based social learning platform designed to solve the problem of disconnected learning environments. It allows students to collaborate, share events, and engage in discussions, fostering a sense of community.
  * **InvestIQ:** An AI-driven platform that addresses the challenge of identifying high-potential startups. It analyzes startup data to provide recommendations for funding and predict success, empowering investors to make data-driven decisions.
  * **EchoMood:** A mood-based music playlist generator that tackles the issue of static music playlists. It detects emotions from facial expressions, text, and voice to create adaptive playlists that match the user's current mood.
  * **Color Detection Project:** A computer vision tool built with OpenCV that can identify single and multiple colors from a live webcam feed. This project was an exploration into the practical applications of computer vision.
